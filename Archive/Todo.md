- [x] Borrow ideas from BetterBlizzPlates, add totem & important mobs grow & shrink animations

- [ ] Customize which spells to track cooldowns for
  - Option to show aura only, aura + cooldown, or just disable/enable?
  - Problem with disable/enable is some short cooldowns are not worth tracking but worth showing auras in case of cooldown stacking
  - Premake icons regardless of whether they are enabled or not, and activate only if they are enabled by the player
